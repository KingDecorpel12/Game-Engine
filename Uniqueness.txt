This is a simple item collecting level. You are a robot on a planet on the far ends of the universe, and you are hunting for Energon, the life force of your people.
In this simple level, you can move the robot left or right using either the left/right arrow keys or the "A" and "D" keys. Each time you press on the space button,
the level spawns more Energon for you to pick up. When you feel you are done, go to the portal to exit the level. 

The uniqueness of this game comes from being able to spawn an item at your disposal, picking up items, and having a nice message pop up once you go to the portal to exit 
the level. Enjoy!
